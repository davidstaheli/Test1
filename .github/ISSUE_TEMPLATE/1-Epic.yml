      description: >
        People "hire" products and services to get a "job" done. Jobs are functional â€” with emotional and social components.
        People buy a kettle not to boil water, but to prepare a hot beverage for consumption. Jobs are solution agnostic.
        Innovation becomes predictable when "needs" are defined as the metrics customers use to measure success when getting the job done.
